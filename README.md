# hub-frontend-draft
This project is a draft design for the frontend.

As this design becomes progressively more complex we will introduce templating - probably using Jekyll.

The purpose of this project is to explore various designs or widgets for use in Community 2.0.

Eventually we may want to extend this project to include a distribution of bootstrap that ships with an MTAy look and feel,
but that is not the aim right now.

## Why "hub"?

It's just quicker to type than community. The use of the name of "MTA hub" is just for convenience, and has no significance otherwise. We have no plans to rename Community at the moment.
